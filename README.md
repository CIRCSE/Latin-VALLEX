# Latin-VALLEX: Latin Valency lexicon

_Latin VALLEX_ is a valency lexicon for Latin. It was built in close connection with the semantic/pragmatic annotation of the [Index Thomisticus Treebank](https://itreebank.marginalia.it/) and the Latin Dependency Treebank.

Latin-VALLEX currently contains around 2,500 valency frames for more than 1,000 lexical entries.

Data are stored in a single XML file, whose structure is the same of that for the valency lexicon for Czech PDT-VALLEX, which is described at http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz/pdt2.0/doc/data-formats/pdt-vallex/pdt-vallex-struct.html.

Latin-VALLEX is accessible through a PML-TQ web application at https://itreebank.marginalia.it/vallex/app/form.
